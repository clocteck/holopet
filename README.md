# Clawd Monitor for HoloCubic

Clawd Monitor displays live Codex lifecycle state and local hourly weather on a
320 x 240 HoloCubic. Every mascot frame is generated from the canonical 12 x 8
sprite from clawdmoji project.

Version 1.4.1 adds Bluetooth controller exit support: press `SELECT` or `HOME`
to return to Launcher.

## Display

- Codex state animations are native 160 x 160 indexed GIFs. There is no runtime
  scaling or cropped desktop artwork.
- IDLE rotates every random 2 to 5 whole minutes through 24 narrative loops:
  12 everyday micro-stories with two reactions/directions each. Every story
  uses varied frame timing, a calm setup, an interaction, and a seamless return
  over roughly 6.8 seconds instead of repeating a short mascot-plus-prop pose.
- Each supported Codex Hook event has 4 distinct expressions (Stop has 5),
  with separate Error and Sleeping families.
- The launcher icon is a native 75 x 75 ClawdMoji render with no resampling.
- Codex state, project, tool category, and connection state appear below Clawd.
- The lower panel uses a square-edged Powerline/Oh My Zsh prompt treatment.
  Its state and state-timer segments inherit the current Clawd state color.
- By default the app normalizes `language`, `locale`, or `lang` from
  `/sd/apps/settings.json`. Its WebUI can override that choice with Chinese or
  English, or switch back to following the system. English uses the bundled
  monospaced `Clawd Console` face; Chinese uses the bundled `AIDA Noto Sans SC`
  face. The same fixed language is passed to the screen, weather client, and
  WebUI, and changing it automatically reloads the app.
- A native application module rasterizes 10, 12, 14, 16, and 28 px text with
  horizontal RGB subpixel coverage, pre-composites it into RGB565, and sends the
  finished pixels to small LVGL canvases. If Chinese rendering cannot start,
  the screen falls back to readable English firmware text and reports the real
  font error in the WebUI instead of leaving blank labels.
- Non-idle states show `Cmm:ss` for the current chat/turn and `Smm:ss` for the
  uninterrupted current state, followed by weekly usage, a proportional bar,
  and the weekly reset date.
- A fresh IDLE screen labels those slots as `C CHAT / S STATE`; after a session
  completes, it keeps the previous total as `Cmm:ss / LAST`.
- The top bar shows the device-local time beside the bridge status. At startup,
  the app reads the POSIX `timezone` value from `/sd/apps/settings.json`, applies
  it through the runtime time module, and honors configured DST transition rules.

## Weather instrument

The weather page reads the location already stored by the system in
`/sd/apps/settings.json`. It resolves that city through Open-Meteo geocoding and
requests current conditions plus 8 hours of hourly temperature, humidity,
precipitation probability/amount, wind direction/speed, and gusts.

The device clock and weather location are intentionally configured separately:
`timezone` controls the app clock, while `weather_address` selects the forecast
location. Open-Meteo timestamps use the resolved city's IANA timezone; the
`DATA` time is therefore local to the forecast city, while `SYNC` uses the
device timezone.

The hero animation is selected from 60 generated ClawdMoji scenes: 10 weather
families multiplied by 6 temperature/humidity moods. The rail prioritizes the
next three hours' rain probability/time and maximum gust, followed by four
hourly cells. The last good forecast remains visible if a refresh fails.

## Connection

### Device package

Copy every file inside `package/` to the following directory on the HoloCubic:

```text
/sd/apps/holo_pet/
```

The app supports both `holo_pet` and `holopet` as its directory name. Firmware
app-store installs derive the directory from their manifest `app_id` and may
therefore install this app at `/sd/apps/holopet/`. Rescan the app list (or
restart the device), then launch **Clawd Monitor**.

On the Codex PC, install the bridge and hooks from the repository root:

```powershell
node bridge/install-codex-hook.js
```

The computer and HoloCubic must be on the same LAN. If Codex asks you to review
the new command hook, open `/hooks` and approve it before continuing.

The data path follows the same host-configured pattern as AIDA Monitor:

```text
Codex command hook ----> localhost:17321/event
Codex session JSONL ---> fallback monitor (1.2s poll)
                         -> SSE bridge on the PC
HoloCubic             <- http://HOST:17321/events
```

Open the device management UI and select **Clawd Monitor**. Its independent
page at `/holo_pet/` lets you edit the Codex host IP and port, save/reconnect,
and test `/health`. Defaults:

```text
Host: 192.168.0.100 (replace with the Codex PC's LAN address)
Port: 17321
Path: /events
```

The installer starts `codex-holocubic-server.js` immediately and registers a
hidden per-user Windows logon startup entry. The hook also starts it on demand.
The bridge listens on the LAN so the HoloCubic can maintain an SSE connection.

Official hooks remain the primary path. Until Codex writes a trusted hook hash
after the user reviews `/hooks`, the bridge follows Clawd on Desk's fallback
strategy and incrementally maps the active Codex JSONL session:

- `task_started` / `user_message` -> thinking
- function, custom tool, and web search calls -> working
- `task_complete` -> done

The fallback reads record type metadata and state fields only; it does not send
prompt, assistant, tool argument, or tool output contents to the device.

## Console font compositor

The device package includes one static ASCII TrueType font at
`package/font/clawd_console.ttf`. It is generated from Microsoft's
OFL-licensed Cascadia Mono and renamed `Clawd Console` as a derivative. The
bundled `package/modules/aida_font.so` module performs the same application-side
RGB565 rasterization already proven by AIDA Monitor. This avoids the firmware's
broken `LV_FONT_SUBPX_HOR` paint path, which accepts an LCD font but produces
invisible glyphs on this device. ClawdMoji GIFs are not filtered or antialiased.
The module's standalone ESP-IDF source is versioned under `native/aida_font` so
this repository remains the only build and deployment source.

Rebuild the font asset with Python and `fonttools` from an installed Cascadia
Mono TTF:

```powershell
python tools/build_console_font.py C:\Windows\Fonts\CascadiaMono.ttf
```

The management WebUI reports whether the compositor loaded and whether the
screen is using `RGB subpixel / RGB565 compositor` or the grayscale firmware
fallback.

## Usage limits

Codex App Server officially exposes `account/rateLimits/read` and
`account/rateLimits/updated`. The installed Codex desktop process owns its
App Server over stdio, so this bridge does not start or interfere with a second
authenticated Codex process. Instead, every 30 seconds it reads only the most
recent local `rate_limits` object already emitted into Codex session telemetry.

Only the 10080-minute weekly window is retained and sent to the device:

- weekly `used_percent`
- weekly `resets_at`, formatted as local `MM/DD`

Both the current weekly-only primary-window shape and the older secondary-
window shape are accepted. Legacy 300-minute fields are ignored.

Prompts, responses, tool arguments, and tool results are not parsed or sent.

## Generating the ClawdMoji pack

Regenerate all status and weather assets plus their Lua manifest:

```powershell
python tools\generate_clawdmoji_pack.py
```

The generator also writes contact sheets under `art/` and a build report beside
the generated assets. `art/idle-stories-preview.gif` is a 4 x 3 animated QA
sheet containing one representative variant of every IDLE story.

## Codex hooks

Install or repair the hooks:

```powershell
node bridge/install-codex-hook.js
```

Uninstall only the Clawd Monitor entries:

```powershell
node bridge/install-codex-hook.js --uninstall
```

Codex may ask you to review the command hook. Open `/hooks` and approve it when
prompted. The hook always returns `{}` for `PermissionRequest`, leaving the
decision in Codex's native approval UI.

The installed release exposes these 10 events, all registered by the installer:

- `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`
- `PreToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`, `PostToolUse`
- `PreCompact`, `PostCompact`
- `SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop`, `Stop`

Only lifecycle state, event, project directory name, normalized tool category,
session id, model slug, and subagent id are forwarded. Prompt and assistant
contents are not sent.
